# **CSCD58---Data-Leakage-Detection-Tool-Project**

## **Description and Explanation of the Project**

The **Data Leakage Detection Tool** is a simplified yet practical system designed to detect potential data leakage within a network. The project focuses on real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated response to mitigate risks. Leveraging tools like Mininet for network simulation, Wireshark for traffic analysis, and Scapy for packet handling, this tool provides foundational support for network security.


### **Project Goals**
1. **Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - Capture and inspect network traffic using tools like Mininet and Wireshark.
   - Monitor key attributes such as packet size, destination IP, and access patterns to establish a baseline for normal behavior.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implement signature-based and statistical methods for detecting abnormal behaviors, such as large data transfers or unknown IP addresses.
   - Explore machine learning techniques like clustering or isolation forests for advanced anomaly detection (if time permits).

3. **Alert and Response Mechanism**:
   - Develop a notification system with categorized threat severity levels.
   - Automate responses like IP blacklisting to minimize potential damage.

4. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Simulate data leakage scenarios in controlled environments using Mininet.
   - Measure performance with metrics like false positives/negatives.

5. **Documentation and Presentation**:
   - Produce a detailed report covering all phases of the project.
   - Create a video demonstration showcasing the tool’s functionality.
